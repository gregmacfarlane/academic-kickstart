# Biography

I am an assistant professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering
department at Brigham Young University. I research transportation engineering
and planning, with a specific emphasis in using modern passive data products to
build models of travel behavior and land development.

I wonder if this would look okay with a second paragraph.

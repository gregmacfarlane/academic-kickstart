Last week the Deseret News ran a contributed
[opinion piece by Andrew Skabelund](https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/8/10/21358753/guest-opinion-utah-county-tech-centric-future-human-natural-resources-silicon-slopes-farming-desert)^[Who was a friend and classmate of mine way back at Wasatch Elementary School!]
in which he argued that the rapid development of Silicon Slopes in north Utah
County comes at the cost of Utah County's value as agricultural land. He cites
an interesting fact (originally credited to Jared Farmer) I had not known previously:

> the Native Americans living in Utah Valley did not see the mountains as the
> primary feature of the landscape; instead, their perspective was dominated by
> Utah Lake and the Provo River, which --- though hard to believe now --- were
> abundant sources of food. In fact, it was fishing expeditions to Utah Valley
> that kept the first pioneers alive in the Salt Lake Valley.

>As Utah Lake lost its vibrant productivity, due in large measure to
>overfishing, industrial pollution and watershed disruption from irrigation and
>overgrazing, it also lost its cultural significance. Mount Timpanogos became
>the dominant cultural landmark for most Utah residents, and if you’ve grown up
>here, it’s a bit shocking to learn that our lake was anything but some smelly,
> murky carp aquarium.

I agree with Skabelund that Utah County's growth has come at great cost to the
natural environment, and that this growth has not necessarily come with an
increased standard of living for the Valley's residents. I too miss the orchards
that have been paved over with soulless strip malls, and wish the Provo River
could sustain robust wild trout populations into Utah Lake.

Where I disagree with Skabelund, however, is believing that the choice between
preservation and growth is an either-or proposition. What is required is not to
curtail growth, but rather to grow *sustainably*.

Many residents of Utah County understand values of prudent planning, and of
making choices today that will result in blessings tomorrow. It is sad therefore
that city councils and planning commissions throughout the valley appear to
eagerly accept whatever developers wish to build, with little forethought to how
these developments will impact future growth.

The interchange of SR-92 with I-15 in Lehi was in the middle of a years-long
construction project when I moved away from Utah in 2010. When I moved back in
2019, it was again in the middle of a years long construction project.
One might reasonably ask why UDOT cannot plan more than ten years in advance when
its civil infrastructure is designed to last for 50 or 75 years.  The true
answer is that Silicon Slopes was not in the plan. Maybe it should have been,
or maybe planning officials should have considered how the placement and
design of these office facilities would affect traffic and air quality before
blindly approving whatever was set in front of them.

A freeway lane operating at full capacity can carry roughly 2,000 vehicles per
hour. FrontRunner operating at its full design capacity^[150 passengers per car,
10 car trains, 4 trains per hour] could carry 6,000 people per hour.
Utah County planners need to stop seeing FrontRunner as a novelty that moves
a few people who don't want to drive and instead see it as the *centerpiece* of
the county's transportation infrastructure. There is a FrontRunner Station at
the heart of Silicon Slopes! The nearest things to it are a golf course and 22
acres of parking lot.

Current development practices in Utah County are a smorgasbord of missed and
incomplete opportunities like this. UVX is a fabulous project that has earned
national attention for its runaway success; this success is in spite of a major
automobile dealership being the nearest business to fully three of the system's
eighteen stops. Home developers in Pleasant Grove and Springville have been
building attractive and popular semi-detached or fully detached homes on
small-footprint lots; neighborhoods like this make it easier for residents to
walk to schools, shops, or transit and also conserve water by eliminating useless
lawn space. But these particular neighborhoods are hemmed into former industrial
or agricultural lots without access to any of these additional community
resources.

By 2050, more people are projected to live in Utah County than in Salt Lake
County. Continuing to build large single-family homes, strip malls, freeway lanes,
and office parks dominated by parking will destroy what is left of our water and
air quality. But there things each city should do to grow sustainably:

  1. Develop a master transportation plan that prioritizes active transportation
  and public transit.
  1. Require that new  developments contribute to this plan in their designs.
  This often means placing parking behind developments so that cyclists and
  pedestrians do not have to cross acres of parking lot.
  1. Build housing for families of all sizes, structures, and incomes.
  1. Implement tax incentives that promote higher density developments around
  transit stations and in the city core. A
  [land value tax](https://www.strongtowns.org/landvaluetax) would use the
  power of the market to accomplish these objectives.
  1. Implement an [urban growth boundary](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/urban-growth-boundary)
  to change the economic incentives that favor unsustainable sprawl.

We cannot in fact eat silicon. We might be able to have our silicon and still
eat our apricots long into the future if we can make it a priority to do so.

# First-level heading

Markdown is a text file, which you will edit in a text editor (like computer
code). A good free text editor is [Atom](atom.io), and it includes packages to 
help you edit markdown files. There are also lots of tutorials online, including
[this one](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Second-level heading

This is how you include a [reference link](https://ceen.byu.edu/). You can also 
have footnotes^[like this one] if you want. Lists can be

  - bulleted
  - numbered
  
If you want to include a picture, upload the picture to [imgur.com](imgur.com) or
another web image hosting platform. Then, get the direct link to the image (the one that
ends in `.png`) and put it in the string below.
